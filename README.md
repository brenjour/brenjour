## About

Hello! This is my first website I've ever made. More specifically, this is the repository of my personal blog. 

The theme is based off of [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper), which is a port of Ghost's default theme [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper). 

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Feel free to fork, change, modify and re-use any part of my repository. Or feel free to use the original theme itself.
