I realized that I haven't been able to write my words out in the time I've wanted too recently. I mean, I can't really seem to grasp writing a lot of things out at once. I have started to take a slow pace. Begrudgingly snail-like. So this entry is more-or-less just a warm-up for myself. It's 2 in the morning and I've been awake for a few hours now after waking up from a bad sleep. I didn't think fixing my sleep schedule would be this troublesome, which is bizarrely naive for me, it seems.

### Master Literacy

>**Let the beauty of what you love be what you do.** â€”Rumi

But everything is alright. I don't know why people have such concern over me. I always find a way through whatever is troubling me. Even when I think it's the end of the world at the current time, everything fades, usually a lot faster than you think it will.

I just feel like people don't give me enough credit with how much I do for myself. But I guess that's more my fault since I never communicate anything. Hence this public journal writing. I'm so sick of the discrepancies in my life. I act like an idiot for the sake of humor more often than not and I usually hide this part of me. It's all miscommunication, I've realized that out of everything that's going to be the thing that ends you. If you're forward and honest with people, you can essentially get away with anything. And that seems Machiavellian, but it's true.

That said, I wouldn't recommend it either. Everyone is on a different level somewhere throughout life and it isn't your obligation to try to make someone understand where you're coming from. What I'm trying to say is that, in spite of your best efforts, there still might be miscommunication even if you directly communicate how you feel. Not because you're bad with words or the person you're telling is bad at listening, rather that more often than not there's too stark of a difference in paradigm.

But that's more irrelevant than not. It bothers me more on a level of vanity than anything else.

I think it's vitally more important for me to address *why* I have difficulty with communicating myself rather than passively-aggressively putting the blame on anybody else. Why I have such difficultly actually getting my point across. I mean, maybe I don't, and maybe that just applies to essay writing in school. But it's pretty detrimental to my self-confidence. And that's just in writing, let alone trying to speak.

### & Listening

But, apparently those are my largest strengths. I've been using Elevate for around ten days now and my lowest EQ is in, surprising to me, listening. I actually have written down a multitude of times that I thought the way I learn best is by listening. It turns out it's my biggest weakness, though. All the mini-games Elevate has regarding listening I bomb at and have to retry several times before actually completing. I'm actually not really sure what this is telling of. Maybe it's been my lack of musical learning the past few years that have cause my listening skills to decline.

But I think it's more important to realize that I can improve how well I listen, rather than analyze and berate myself as to why I'm not doing good at it. That's always what I usually did. I'd go through everything wrong with me and never present or try to come up with solutions or improvements.

### Meta Learning

I think one of the wonderful things with all of my meta-learning is how much it allows me to improve.Meta-cognition and self-awareness are skills that need a severe more amount of attention paid too. They are skills that are, obviously, self-serving and if you can constantly learn how to learn, you can learn better, which means you can learn more, etc. The benefits are universal, and not only with learning. It also improves socialization and how you take criticism. One of the reasons I like Danielle is her tact of self-awareness. But, like me, she usually too critical of herself.

You could consider self-awareness to be a subject, even though it's technically a process. I say this because you do still have to figure out the practice and application.

At the same time, you also have to make sure that you *actually* do something as well. Because as great as self-realization is, if you don't actually apply it to anything it goes completely to waste. That's why I'm trying to learn valuable skills like coding and French in the meantime.
