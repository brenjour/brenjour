It's late, or maybe early. Almost 4am to be precise. It also hasn't been January 3rd for almost four hours confidentially but my sleep schedule isn't in best shape at the moment.

### [4 in the Morning](https://www.ted.com/talks/rives_on_4_a_m?language=en)

>**I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process.** —Vincent Van Gogh

There's a trick (cheating) that I use on 750words, where I originally write my entry, that allows me to write until four in the morning because of timezone optionality. It's definitely a bad habit I've gotten into but it'll sort itself out once I begin sleeping at a normal time again.

### Mediocre Academia

Which will have to be tonight, since school starts in roughly in a day. I'm pretty underwhelmed by going back, both because I only have two weeks left until *another* exam break and also because I've become pretty disillusioned by my school as a whole. But that's another can of worms in itself.

### Sleep?

It's good though, because I do need to start sleeping at night instead of in the morning. I had a really long nap in the middle of today after going into a slight food coma from McDonald's so I plan on not going to bed until 7pm or 8pm tonight.

That said, this is my last day to get a lot of work done and I'm not sure how awake I'll be able to be. Good thing I have unlimited coffee.

Byron came back today, too. He's really fun to have around and I enjoy watching videos and playing video games with him but he couldn't come at a worse time regarding my schoolwork. I know it isn't his fault because I really should have had everything I needed to done ages ago but I have just had such trouble not procrastinating. But it is hard to say no to him.

### Neue Music

In good news I found out that Spotify is available in Canada! I'm thankful for it because it means that the fact I still haven't been able to transfer any music to my new iPod isn't a problem anymore. It has a few ads and doesn't let you actually choose songs but rather makes you shuffle whatever you want to listen too, but that's actually great since I want to just expose myself to new music.

I haven't been able to listen to anything new in so long because I've been too busy too invest my time getting to learn about new artists. It's difficult to find out about them anyway.

### Turquoise Worries

I don't really know how things are going to work out at school though, mainly because I don't know when I'm getting my laptop back exactly. I hope it's soon, I also hope that the heating is fixed for Byron at home. Not that I don't like having him around, I just want things to be okay for him.

## Gratis

This morning (?) I'm grateful for the following:

1. Spotify! Unlimited music is so nice.
2. Danielle! Although she's far more of a permanent, but she's provided me a lot of comfort recently.
3. Hot homemade apple pie with cold vanilla ice cream. Albeit probably bad for my diet.

## Goals

### To-Do

#### Right Now | January 4th

3. Configure Reporter's questions so I actually start using it again. No sense wasting the $3.99 I spent on it.
4. Sort out and finish the rest of the schoolwork I have.
5. Work out.

#### This Week | January 5th-12th

**School**

1. Get help regarding essays.
2. Start and finish Excel module before ~January 20th.

**Work**

1. Get my resume completed—both traditional and digital—and apply for jobs.
2. Spruce up social networking presence with priority on LinkedIn
3. Learn enough about Jekyll and AdSense to start a blog up already.
4. Write a few posts for that blog.

### Meta Talk

Regarding goals, I've modified how I write them out with the following criteria:

1. Start prioritizing (numbering) things. Both literally and generally in life.
2. Start writing things in first person.
3. Start writing things with dates.
4. Eventually start putting goals into categories.
5. Actually start working on Project Aileron.

I've also decided to put media consumption as a last headline in Jottings as opposed to it having it's own category due to it's low prioritization.

I've wanted to get more daily artistes involved (poetry, photography, etc.) in Kalend but it seems redundant. I'll probably just add another headline into it. Probably something along the lines of: "I wrote X (about Y) and it had Z words" or "I took a photo of X and entitled it Y".
