Here we are again. After a quick nap from 4am to 11am I'm back to writing my journal with another coffee in my hand at 3pm, trying once again to get my work done for the day. It's especially important that I get my PowerPoint assignments done before Byron comes over again. Even though New Year's was surprisingly warm, there's now a snowfall warning in effect and my Mom's house isn't heated enough for my little brother's room.

### Twelve Hours Later

Be as you wish to seem. —Socrates

I took a break for a few hours. Alright, maybe more than a few hours, it's two in the morning now. I can't believe so much time passes between trying to do homework and finding new exciting things to do! And by that, I obviously mean me just trying to pass the time by procrastinating.

### Multiple Single Intelligences

A good example is another app I've just found called Brainscape. It's a simple flashcard based trainer but it's surprisingly fun. I found it by chance while looking up Git clients on my iPod when it came up as Git Commands. I thought that would be a really helpful resource for me so I downloaded it and ended up also getting the following:

* Astrology—for historical purposes.
* Blackjack—for mathematical purposes.
* Driver's Ed—because I'm almost three years overdue for my license.
* Git Commands—for geeky pack-rat like behavior with my future code.
* Keyboard Shortcuts—which cut 20% of time one spends on the computer, apparently.
* Music Theory Concepts—which I am ridiculously rusty at and I'm really excited to relearn. I even paid for it.
* Proverbs and Idioms—because an apple a day!
* Ruby on Rails—mainly because I hate myself and want to learn the hardest code first.
* Survival French—to supplement Duolingo.
* The Brain—because learning about mental disorders and cortex's is really fun!
* Vocab Workout—because I know, like, fifty words.

This is in addition to using Elevate and Duolingo. I'm not entirely sure I'm a firm believer in the actual benefits of neuroplasticity, but I am legitimately learning new things—and a new language! So I'm more than content.

### Yesterday

In all of my idle distractions I completely forgot about telling you what happened during New Year's Eve!

It was honestly the most eventual and wonderful New Year's I've ever had. I don't even think I've actually went out before, and so just actually going out was great by itself! But going out with Danielle made it so much better. Of course, maybe other things happened before we actually went out, haha.

We went downtown to Olympic Plaza and it was so great! There were a lot of people skating on the ice, we hung out for awhile for a few hours before midnight. There was a really cool show for the last half hour before, and cool music. I dug it. And then the clock struck and there were surprise fireworks and we kissed! It was kinda magical, gosh.

I feel like I'm being so ditzy and romantic in my description, but it's true.

## Gratis

As I said yesterday, I'm not sure I'm having the best of time writing out this part of Kalend yet.[1] But I'm gradually going over the long-term things I'm grateful for, so today I'll try to hash out what I'm grateful for in the present moment.

I'm grateful for...

* Everything around me right now. That's a lot of things though, so I'll expand.
* Writing on this couch, it's warm and comfortable.
* Having my laptop and being able to use the internet to write and save my daily thoughts.
* Watching The Sunset Limited in otherwise silence.
* Having the ability to drink Orange Soda, but won't out of resolution.

After trying this a couple times it seems a lot easier than I pressured myself to think it as.

## Media Consumption

I watched all of the 5th Season of *The Walking Dead* because a marathon was playing on AMC and I missed a few episodes at the end when they were premiering. It turned out to have a pretty confusing finale, I have no idea why they killed Beth, and there are so many slow and dull parts throughout the entire show I don't really know why it's so popular. I should probably read the comics at some point. The only comic I've ever read has been *Watchmen*, admittedly.

## Meta Talk

I just realized how much I'm going to end up talking about Kalend itself so I might as well add a section about talking about it for future perspective when I begin writing Project Aileron.

^1. Jottings should only be referred to as the beginning journal entry. Kalend regards the document as a whole. This is a Daily Kalend entry and I'll be configuring a Weekly, Monthly and Yearly which will be completed on my Birthday.

I'm going to try a new section of Kalend about my media consumption. I don't know if I can incorperate it better, but like everything else, I'll just play it by ear.
