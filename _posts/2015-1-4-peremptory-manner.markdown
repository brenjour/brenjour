This entry is going to be a little short. I have anxieties about going back to school tomorrow and I'm going to go to bed early tonight and write tomorrow morning as planned.

### A Short Clause

>**Breathless, we flung us on a windy hill, Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.** â€”Rupert Brooke

I've been reading my past entries, perhaps a mistake. But I've promised myself that I'm going to allow myself more retrospective this year.

I can't believe how radical and ridiculous I was only a few years ago. Maybe it was my fondness for literature and poetry, the first thing I ever wrote about. I fell so hard, so quickly. I don't even know what I was really looking for, I still don't in all honesty. Definitely cringe inducing though.

I figure I will transfer the entries to their own site, but it'll be only for private use.

## Goals

### To-Do

#### Meta

* Write out the weekly / monthly review template.
* After this month is over, I'm experimenting with visualizing aspects of Reporter's .csv / .json files and incorporate the information into my weekly / monthly review.

## Meta Talk

I think it's important for me not to prioritize Jottings, as much as I enjoy it. There's so much I need to write for other things, like schoolwork and coding and creative work and blog posts.

Another, smaller note is that I'm going to be no longer labeling Jottings with a headline anymore purely for design reasons.

I've been thinking about using tags, and I should, I'm just weary about the publicity on tumblr by doing so. I could transfer websites but this is so easy.

I'm also going to reverse the date and title format.

Regarding goals, I'm going to be writing them all in present verb form to reaffirm them better.

### 750words

First and foremost, I'm paying 750words $5.00 for messing up the January challenge by being 200 words short on the first day. I definitely owe a few hundred dollars by now for all the times I signed up for the monthly challenged, promised to donate if I failed, and then failed and never ended up donating. Once I get stable income, I'll become a patron and subscribe to the monthly fee. In fact, I'll do that for somebody else who's really impassioned about writing to pay for their account since this one is still free. (Boo-yah!)


#### Badges

In spite of the fact I've used 750words for over four years and have yet to get anything over 14 days in a row, I'm confident with my new attitude I'll be able to maintain my current streak until the site closes down!

**Specialty Badges**

* I'm earning the *Early Rooster* badge by writing between 5am and 9am ten days in a row, starting tomorrow on the 5th. I'll have it earned by **January 14th, 2015.**
* I'm earning the *Cheetah* badge by completing my 750 words per day (WPD) under 20 minutes.  I'll also have it earned by January 14th, 2015.
* I'm earning the *Turquoise Horse* badge by actually (and *finally*) completing the monthly challenge. Since I already messed up this month, I'm going to earn this badge **March 1st, 2015** or maybe February 1st, if I'm lucky.
* **I have failed the monthly challenge 15 times since signing up for 750words.**
* Update: I just checked the website and for some weird reason I'm not actually out of January's challenge yet. I'm not sure if this glitch is going to be fixed or not, but I'm not going to hold my breath about it.
* As of right now, I've written a total of 138,715 words and completed 144 days since **September 17th, 2011.**
* This means that, if I'm writing only 750 WPD, I'm going to earn the *Double Flock* badge of writing 250,000 words in total in only 149 days. Which means I'm going to earn it **June 2nd, 2015.**
* Continuing on this trend, I'll reach 500,000 words and the *Triple Flock* badge on **May 6th, 2016.**
* I'm pacing my writing. I'm writing 850 WPD this month, 950 WPD in February until I get to 1,750 WPD around **November, 2015** to ease into NaNoWriMo and get it's named badge.

**Length Badges**

* I'm earning my *Albatross* badge by consecutively writing 750 WPD until **Feburary 2nd, 2015.**
* I'm earning my *Phoenix* badge by consecutively writing 750 WPD until **April 13th, 2015.** (Happy Birthday, me.)
* I'm earning my *Pterodactyl* badge by consecutively writing 750 WPD until **July 22nd, 2015.**
* I'm earning my *Pegasus* badge by consecutively writing 750 WPD until **January 2nd, 2016.**
* I'm earning my final badge, the *Space Bird*, by consecutively writing 750 WPD until **May 16th, 2016.**
