### Year in Review

>**I think in terms of the day's resolutions, not the years'.** â€”Henry Moore

And another year has passed. I'm up near midnight with a cup of coffee writing out my first entry for 2015. It's been a wakeful year for me, I suppose. I started writing to you again in February after not writing for a long time. To be precise, I lasted a ten-day streak in late November of 2012 and didn't write any actual, quality entries since. I'm almost proud to say that I wrote at least twice every single month this year, though! Writing for almost all of February.

Of course, that's just my journal writing. I guess I could say I've done more, but I'm not really sure I've done too much.

I started my last year of high school in September. I was planning on taking IT Essentials at the Career and Technology Centre after having to drop Art 20 because Irene was such a ridiculously bad teacher. The class didn't actually happen because there wasn't enough interest (surprise, surprise) so instead I took Media Design and Financial Management.

Although Media Design turned out to be a ticket to an easy 90% without any actual learning, Financial Management turned out to be a boon for me because I ended up joining a program for students called Junior Achievement where students form groups outside of school to learn how to run a business. I ended up as President of my company, and that's something I'm proud of.

As I wrote above, I've also begun having interest in programming and learning how to code. I started using Codecademy in September and admittedly didn't get much done this year on it other than HTML5 and CSS3. However I plan to complete *all* lessons by the end of the year. Prioritizing JavaScript, Python and probably PHP. I also need to learn Jekyll and probably Wordpress for blogging purposes.

I'll be sure to add more tomorrow!

## Gratis

This section of Jottings it probably the most difficult for me right now. I originally came up with the idea way back in October and still haven't fulfilled it. It's a ridiculously simple and unoriginal concept of writing down three things in your life that you're grateful for.

To keep things simple for myself, I'll write out three permanent things as opposed to three in-the-moment things. 

1. I was born, at all.
2. I was born on planet Earth.
3. I was born as a human being.
4. I was born as a white-passing, het-passing, cismale.
5. I was born with a good figure that's easy to maintain.
6. I was born in the 21st Century, which is a pretty arbitrary time-frame but long story short I was born during the greatest time ever for technology and knowledge. // Expand on this later.
7. I was born in Canada, probably the best country in the world outside of Scandinavia currently.
8. I was moved to Calgary at a young age, Canada's most thriving city. Hopefully with the present oil prices there will be a revolution of our economy.
9. I was born with a roof over my head and have a lot of expensive devices. 

## Goals

### To-Do

Although there is plenty of schoolwork and personal development that I need to be working on, regarding my journal writing itself, I have some important new goals I want to achieve this year:

* Take time out of the week to actually review my entries. Realize ways to improve both my syntax and attitude. This is a hard bullet it bite, since I've never done it before and I'm pretty hard on myself.
* Learn to write in Gratis everyday. It's important for me to learn how to be grateful and write about being grateful as well as I have at writing journal writing.
* Possibly make an archive website for all of my entries starting from 2011. This will be time-consuming and also problematic due to how I used to write, using the tab key which caused all of the paragraphs to jumble together because Markdown treats that as code.

In regards to everything else:

* Keep adding things to Coach.me and write out somewhere all the reminders I currently have in place and use it as a basic schedule for myself.
* All of my Language Arts and Financial Management work.
* Update blog, make more blogs and write more articles.
* **AILERON!**

### Finished

* Signed up with Coach.me which is a really cool social networking website and app based on reaching goals and making good habits!
* Have a five day streak on Elevate, a brain-traning app. Should probably find more.
* My first entry of the year!

## Meta Talk

That's nine just right there! I'll be adding stuff like that to the Gratitude page in Edex as opposed to Gratis in Jottings. The difference being that Edex is for long-term, stuff that doesn't change much. Whereas Gratis is a part of Kalend which is daily writing about temporal things. Something I could add to that would be that I still have a three-day weekend to enjoy before having only two weeks of school!
